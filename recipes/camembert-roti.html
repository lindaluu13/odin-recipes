    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Its comforting thick gooeyness and delicious unmistakable flavour make this the food of the gods and perfect as the days get colder and darker.</p>
    <p>Maybe this is why we often save it for Christmas?! But while I have never been known for letting camembert pass me by over the festive holiday, it is also perfect for any other time of year too. 
        Whether you're trying to impress guests or want to treat yourself to a fancy teatime dipping, this French favourite is here for you.
        In case you don't already know, baking camembert is ridiculously easy.</p>
