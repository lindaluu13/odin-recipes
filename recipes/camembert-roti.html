    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Its comforting thick gooeyness and delicious unmistakable flavour make this the food of the gods and perfect as the days get colder and darker.</p>
    <p>Maybe this is why we often save it for Christmas?! But while I have never been known for letting camembert pass me by over the festive holiday, it is also perfect for any other time of year too. 
        Whether you're trying to impress guests or want to treat yourself to a fancy teatime dipping, this French favourite is here for you.
        In case you don't already know, baking camembert is ridiculously easy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A whole camembert wheel - These are usually about 250g</li>
        <li>2 fresh garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Runny honey</li>
        <li>Fresh thyme - Leaves only</li>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Unbox and unwrap the cheese, then return to the box (see notes if it doesn't have a box!)</li>
        <li>Score the cheese with a sharp knife into diamonds.</li>
        <li>Slice the garlic and press it into the cuts of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Drizzle over honey, thyme leaves and salt. Bake as per the recipe at the bottom of this page.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 deg Celsius/200 deg Celsius</li>
        <li>Sit the box on a baking sheet and put into the oven for 15-18 minutes or until the cheese is turning golden on top and is very soft within.</li>
        <li>It is ready when it is turning golden on top and very soft underneath. Be careful not to overcook!</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
