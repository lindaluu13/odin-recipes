        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Blanquette de veau</strong> is a French veal stew.</p>
        <p>In the classic version of the dish the meat is simmered in a white stock and served in a sauce velouté enriched with cream and egg. 
        It is among the most popular meat dishes in France.</p>
        <p>The name <em>"blanquette"</em> derives from "blanc", the French word for white, and there is a purist view that the whiteness of the dish is key, and coloured vegetables such as carrots should not be included.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg of veal</li>
            <li>2 carrots</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>Cream</li>
            <li>20 cl of lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>Herbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stud the onion with the cloves.  Place the veal in a casserole dish and add the carrots, onion, leek and bouquet garni.  Pour in the wine and add just enough water to cover the meat and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat so that the mixture is just simmering now, and add in the bouquet garni. Cover the pot with a lid, and let the veal cook for an hour and a half, or until it's tender.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 tbsp unsalted butter in a pan over medium heat. Once melted, add in the mushroom slices and sauté until tender. Then temporarily set the mushrooms aside</li>
            <li>Create your basmati rice by first rinsing the rice in water in a saucepan. Drain the rice, then add 3 cups of water to the rice in the saucepan. Add a teaspoon of table salt and the vegetable oil, then stir everything to combine. Turn on the heat to high and let the mixture come to a boil. Once the water has reached just below the surface of the rice, turn the heat all the way down to low and place a lid on the rice. Cook for at least 40 minutes to 1 hour, or until tender.</li>
            <li>Once the veal in your stew is tender, add in the carrots and leeks. Cook for another 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, create a roux by melting 2 tbsp of unsalted butter in a separate pan. As the butter is melting, add in the garlic and stir until the butter is totally melted. Add the flour into the melted butter and garlic and stir to create a paste; about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the roux to the stew, stirring it into the stew to combine, and then remove the bouquet garni. Add in the sautéed mushrooms, stirring to blend those in as well. If you're ready to serve your stew, then proceed to the next step. If you're waiting on guests or waiting to serve your dinner, simply put the lid on your stew and keep the stew on low heat.</li>
            <li>Once you're ready to serve dinner, stir in the crème fraiche. Let the cream cook in the stew for a few minutes so the cream can warm up, then adjust any seasoning by tasting the stew for salt and pepper, adding as needed. Finally, stir in a pinch of cloves into the stew. It's now ready to serve over a bed of rice.</li>
        </ol>
