            <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>100g/3Â½oz carrot, grated</li>
            <li>2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>400ml/14fl oz stock (made from stock cube. Ideally beef, but any will do)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and once hot add the beef mince and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the mince until well browned over a medium-high heat (be careful not to burn the mince. It just needs to be a dark brown colour). Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the saucepan you browned the mince in and turn the heat to medium. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the grated carrot then pour the mince and any juices in the bowl back into the saucepan.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well to mix. Pour in the stock, bring to a simmer and then reduce the temperature to simmer gently for 45 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and rich. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook the spaghetti, heat a large saucepan of water and add a pinch of salt. Cook according to the packet instructions. Once the spaghetti is cooked through, drain and add to the pan with the bolognese sauce. Mix well and serve.</li>
        <li>This bolognese sauce can be cooked in advance and frozen. Leave to cool completely then pop in a freezer-proof container, it will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months.</li>
