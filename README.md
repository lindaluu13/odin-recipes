# odin-recipes

## Description

This recipe page is an exercice in The Odin Project - Foundations Course (HTML Foundations). It consists of creating a recipe page from scratch in HTML and CSS, just by following the instructions in the assignment section. This project took place at the end of November 2024, so it's Christmas themed.

## Requirements

- View TOP's requirements [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). No buttons in each recipe's page were required, same goes for the style added with CSS, at this point. It was just there to make it more appealing and practical.
